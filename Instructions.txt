You need to submit Cat, Dog, Storable and Talkable.

Cat and Dog are subclasses of Animal.

Storable and Talkable are Interfaces.

The second argument to the constructors is the ordering key. For Dog use the positive value, for Cat use the negative value. This defines your compareTo. 
The third argument is for cat, it's color, but for dog, it's weight.
